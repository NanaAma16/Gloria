Consider one sample drawn from the following data generating process (DGP) which we will simulate in R:\n\nljt set.seed(123) n &lt;- 25 x &lt;- rnorm(n,mean=0.0,sd=1.0) beta0 &lt;- 1 beta1 &lt;- 0 ## x is irrelevant in this model, the data generating process is as follows: dgp &lt;- beta0 + beta1*x ## The residual is heteroskedastic by construction e &lt;- x^2*rnorm(n,mean=0.0,sd=1.0) y &lt;- dgp + e}\n\n\nCompute the OLS estimator of \\(\\beta_2\\) and its standard error using the lm() command in R or the reg command in Stata for the model \\(y_i=\\beta_1+\\beta_2 x_i+\\epsilon_i\\) based on the DGP given above. Next, compute the standard error of \\(\\hat\\beta_2\\) by computing \\(\\hat\\sigma^2(X'X)^{-1}\\) in using matrix commands in R or Stata, and verify that the two standard error estimates are identical.\n\n\n\n\nCompute White’s heteroskedasticity consistent covariance matrix estimator (you may use the written functions, e.g., hccm function with the option type=\"hc0\" from the R package car) and report the White estimator of the standard error of \\(\\hat\\beta_2\\). Compare this with that from a) above.\n\n\n\nUse the state-level data on murder rates and executions in MURDER for the following exercise. If you are using R, save the file “murder.RData” to your working directory and use the command load(Murder.RData).\n\n\n\nConsider the unobserved effects model \\[mrdrte_{it}=\\eta_t+\\beta_1exec_{it}+\\beta_2unem{it}+a_i+u_i\\] where \\(\\eta_t\\) simply denotes different year intercepts and \\(a_i\\) is the unobserved state effect. If past executions of convicted murderers have a deterrent effect, what should be the sign of \\(\\beta_1\\)? What sign do you think \\(\\beta_2\\) should have? Explain?\n\n\n\n\nUsing just the years 1990 and 1993, estimate the population equation from part i) by pooled OLS.\n\n\n\n\nNow, using 1990 and 1993, estimate the equation by fixed effects. You may use first differencing because yo are only using two years of data. Is there evidence of a deterrent effect? How strong?\n\n\n\n\nCompute the heteroskedasticity-robust standard error for the estimation in part b).\n\n\n\n\nUse all three years of data and estimate the model by fixed effects. Discuss the size and statistical significance of the deterrent effect compared with only using 1990 and 1993."
