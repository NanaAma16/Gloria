## About

I am a Graduate student at the Memorial University of Newfoundland studying M.A. Economics.I am deeply passionate about advancing my knowledge in the field. My academic journey is complemented by hands-on experience as a research/teaching assistant. This experience has not only sharpened my analytical and research skills but has also given me a nuanced understanding of various economic concepts.
